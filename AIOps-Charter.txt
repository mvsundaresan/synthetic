AIOps Charter (One-Page)

Purpose
Leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation to create a self-healing, insight-driven IT operations ecosystem that predicts issues, resolves them autonomously, and continuously captures & codifies operational knowledge for future reuse.

Vision
Deliver always-on, cost-efficient, high-quality digital experiences by transforming IT operations from reactive troubleshooting to proactive prevention and automated knowledge creation.

Scope
• Unified Data Fabric – Aggregate logs, metrics, traces, events, configurations, CMDB, and ticket data into a single, governed platform.
• Intelligent Detection – Apply anomaly detection, causal inference, and pattern recognition to surface emerging incidents before users notice.
• Autonomous Remediation – Execute runbooks and change actions (patch, restart, scale-out, config-tune) through policy-driven orchestration.
• RCA-to-Knowledge Engine – When an incident is closed, an AI agent extracts the validated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) details, auto-generates a Knowledge Article, routes it for SME approval, and publishes it to the service-desk portal.
• Continuous Feedback Loop – Every incident, fix, and knowledge article is fed back into the learning models to improve precision.
• Governance & Compliance – Enforce security, privacy, and auditing standards across data, models, and automation workflows.

Strategic Objectives
